**System Integration and Architecture - Course Expectation**

Throughout the past semesters, I’ve learned a lot of concepts and skills, such as the theory and how to use and implement different programming languages, databases, and computer networking in school activities to real projects. However, I know that I still have more knowledge to gain for me to grow, understand, and improve the skills I already have.

Based on what I read on the internet, this course focuses on planning and implementing both new and existing systems. It is exciting for me because it is not just about building projects; it is also about improving and maintaining them. I remember that whenever I create a system, I often struggle with its structure. As a result, I usually end up encountering issues that lead to frustration.

That’s why my expectation for this course is to lessen the frustrations brought by the lack of planning a strong foundation and structured systems. I also hope to learn various techniques for addressing potential challenges I may encounter during implementation, improving old ones, and ensuring that the systems remain functional in the present.
